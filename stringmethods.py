course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(len(course))
#^^^len means length
# OOP ~ when a function belongs to something else or is specific to some object
print(course.upper())
# ^^^.upper makes the string print in all upper case!
print(course.lower())
print(course.find('g'))
print(course.replace("P", "J"))
print('python' in course)
#^^ Boolean function: is python there or not? It is case sensitive.
